## Housekeeping

### Odd Semester Weeks (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10)

- Tutorial in **1WN 3.24**
- We will cover problem sheets (like in Sem 1)
- Weeks 9 & 10 will both be tutorials — lab work finished

### Even Semester Weeks (2, 4, 6, 8)

- Computer lab with Group C1
- In room **EB 0.7**

### Tutorials

- Hand in problem sheets on **Friday of W2, 4, 6, 8, 10**
- Cover problem sheet material relevant for the exam
- Problem sheets made available the week before the tutorial
- Submit using **pigeonholes (C2)** or **online** to me ([toj26@bath.ac.uk](mailto:toj26@bath.ac.uk)).
- Alternatively, you may wish to hand your sheets in during the Friday lab, this is equally acceptable.
- Deadline: **Friday 5pm**, the week before the tutorial
- I will return sheets in the tutorial
- There will be **6 sheets** — **these are not assessed coursework**
- In tutorials we will cover **Exercises**; in your own time please complete **Problems**
- Please email me for late submissions

### Labs

- There will be **4 lab sheets**
- ⚠️ **Sheets 2 and 4 are assessed**
- Sheets 1 & 3 are formative, but important preparation
- Upload to **Moodle** by **Friday 5pm** (W3, 5, 7, 9)
- I will return grades/feedback the next Friday (W4, 6, 8, 10)

### More on Coursework

- Submission should be in the form of a **Word document**
- For each sheet: mark out of **25** with feedback comments
- 3 marks for presentation — this will be described in the lab sheets

### Late Submissions

- Up to 5 days late: mark **capped at 40%**
- More than 5 days late: **0**
- Please follow the **DoS route** to get an extension if you need one

### AI Statement

- **Must be completed even if AI is not used** — otherwise will incur a penalty

### Important

- No pictures of code or output — you will learn how to compile code in R

## How to Use These Notes

- Each week's page will contains a **summary of key concepts**, **worked examples**, and **practice problems**.
- Solutions to practice problems will be added after each tutorial session.
- If you spot any errors, please let me know.

## Contact

If you have questions outside of tutorial hours, feel free to reach out via email.
- I will also be at **MASH** for 2 hours on a **Thursday (11am–1pm)** if needed
